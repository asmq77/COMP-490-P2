					While visiting Old Faithful in YellowStone National Park,
					I saw a strange glow in the center of the geyser. Against my will,
					I was pulled to it by a magical force. Before I knew it, I was in 
					the center of the earth. I started exploring and came across an open
					door shimmering like the the stars during a clear night. I sat down and
					stared for a while, unsure whether to enter. I suddenly fell asleep.

					I woke up from a one hour nap and found my self staring at the shimmering door that I had seen
					before I fell asleep. I yelled at the top of my lungs, YOLO, and ran through the door. Upon 
					entering, I appeared in a place full of cheese, giant wheels of glowing,
					sparkling cheese and crators full of wine so old it stopped ageing. I knew
					that there was only one place in the universe where this could be possible,
					the center of the Moon!
